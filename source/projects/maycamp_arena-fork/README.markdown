Spoj0 for students
==================

Description
-----------

The idea of this project is to provide a grading system for high school students informatics competitions in [IOI][IOI] style.

The system contains two main components:

* web part
* grader
 
The web part is a rails app contained in the students folder.

The grader is a simple ruby class, which compiles the programs with g++ and runs them using a ruby runner, which observes the resources they use. The runner is runner.rb

Installation
----------------------

There is an automatic installation script, which works for debian based systems. You can read more about it here: [https://github.com/valo/maycamp_arena/wiki/Installation][Install]. It is still WIP, so be patient until it is ready. It should provide a one command deploy for the system, so that you can get started in seconds.
